Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step Implementation Plan that draws directly from the three major reference documents you provided:
	1.	AI-Driven Candidate Matcher: Production-Ready Technical Plan (“Tech Plan”)
	2.	AI-Driven Candidate Matcher (MVP) – Product Requirements Document (“MVP PRD”)
	3.	AI-Driven Candidate Matcher: Architectural and Technical Overview Document (“Arch/Tech Overview”)

The plan is significantly more detailed than a typical simple outline and explicitly references relevant sections from each document. Please note that each phase here directly aligns with the recommended phases or epics described in your documentation, but is consolidated and expanded for clarity.

1. PHASE 0 – DATA PREPARATION & PRELIMINARY DESIGN

Objective

Establish a consistent dataset of resumes and job descriptions, set up your local environment for embedding generation, and confirm baseline retrieval performance before building the full pipeline.

Tasks and References
	1.	Gather/Generate Sample Data
	•	Create or collect a small corpus of resumes and job descriptions in JSON/CSV.
	•	Reference:
	•	MVP PRD, Section 6.1 (Phase 0: Data Preparation) describes gathering synthetic or real data (50–100 resumes and 20–30 jobs) for early testing.
	•	Tech Plan, Section 1.1 mentions importance of real or representative data to ensure embeddings capture domain specifics.
	2.	Define Data Schema
	•	Decide on the minimal set of fields (e.g. candidate_id, text, skills, location, years_experience) for each resume. Similarly for job postings (job_id, description, location, required_skills).
	•	Reference:
	•	Arch/Tech Overview, “Vector Database Implementation” advises storing candidate metadata (like name, location) as part of the vector store or an external DB for filtering.
	3.	Install & Validate Local Embedding Model (Optional)
	•	If you plan to test offline, install FAISS and a local embedding model (e.g. SentenceTransformers) to confirm you can generate embeddings without calling a cloud API.
	•	Reference:
	•	Arch/Tech Overview, “Using FAISS (Local Development)” for in-memory prototyping.
	4.	Create Embedding Scripts
	•	Write a Python script embed_data.py that:
	1.	Reads each resume/job text from your dataset.
	2.	Calls either a local or external embedding model (OpenAI or SentenceTransformers).
	3.	Stores the resulting vector(s) (e.g., in a local pickle or a small FAISS index).
	•	Reference:
	•	MVP PRD, Section 1 (Scope) emphasizes importance of semantic search and data readiness.
	•	Tech Plan, Section 1.1 on how to handle text normalization & consistent model usage.
	5.	Test Basic Retrieval Accuracy
	•	Run a simple test: pick a known job query and confirm that the top retrieved resumes make sense. Evaluate retrieval with small metrics like Recall@K.
	•	Reference:
	•	Tech Plan, Section 1.3 (Evaluation Pipeline) suggests starting with manual checks or simple IR metrics to ensure embedding approach is correct.

2. PHASE 1 – BASIC SEMANTIC SEARCH (MVP CORE)

Objective

Implement the core retrieval pipeline using the vector index. Develop a local or dev environment that can handle “job → candidate” matching purely based on similarity scores (no LLM explanations yet).

Tasks and References
	1.	Set Up Local Development Environment
	•	Ensure you have Python 3.9+ (or 3.11) installed, along with FAISS for local tests.
	•	Reference:
	•	MVP PRD, Section 6.1 (Phase 1: Basic Semantic Search MVP).
	2.	Create a Retriever Module
	•	Create a Python class Retriever that:
	•	Loads the pre-computed candidate embeddings.
	•	Accepts a “job description” or “query text,” embeds it, and searches the vector index (FAISS or Pinecone in dev mode).
	•	Returns top-k results with similarity scores.
	•	Reference:
	•	Tech Plan, Section 1.2 (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Flow) for general structure, though for now skip generation.
	•	Arch/Tech Overview, “Vector Database Implementation (FAISS and Pinecone)” for method signatures.
	3.	Embed and Index the Candidate Data
	•	Using your Phase 0 script, ensure all candidate resumes are embedded and stored in a local FAISS index (in-memory or on-disk).
	•	(Optional) Confirm you can also set up Pinecone for remote indexing.
	•	Reference:
	•	Arch/Tech Overview, “Using FAISS (Local Development)” for code patterns.
	•	Tech Plan, Section 1.1 on the rationale for embeddings.
	4.	Implement a Simple CLI or Python Notebook
	•	Provide a quick way (e.g., python retrieve.py "Software Engineer with 5 years Python") to see the top candidate results in your console.
	•	Reference:
	•	MVP PRD, Section Phase 1 suggests a command-line or Notebook demonstration of retrieval.
	5.	Add Unit Tests
	•	Write tests for the retriever. For instance, check that a “Data Scientist” job query retrieves known relevant candidates in the top results.
	•	Reference:
	•	MVP PRD, Section 6.2 (Testing Strategies) covering basic retrieval accuracy checks.
	6.	Evaluate Retrieval Performance
	•	Measure approximate recall, confirm top matches are relevant. Document any edge cases or major gaps.
	•	Reference:
	•	Tech Plan, Section 1.3 discusses “RAGAS or other frameworks” for partial automated evaluation. For now, you can do manual or Recall@K.

3. PHASE 2 – RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION (RAG) & EXPLANATIONS

Objective

Integrate LLM-based explanation into the flow. The pipeline not only retrieves top candidates but also calls a large language model to generate a short textual explanation for each match.

Tasks and References
	1.	Finalize LLM Provider
	•	Decide if you will use OpenAI (GPT-4 or GPT-3.5) or AWS Bedrock (Claude, AI21, Titan, etc.).
	•	Reference:
	•	Tech Plan, Section 1.2 (RAG Flow) highlights how to prompt an LLM with retrieved documents.
	2.	Implement Generator Module
	•	Create a Python class Generator (or similar) that:
	•	Accepts the job description text + candidate resume text.
	•	Constructs a prompt for the LLM (including instructions to focus on factual alignment).
	•	Calls your LLM endpoint, retrieves the response, and returns a summary/explanation.
	•	Reference:
	•	Arch/Tech Overview, “LLM-Based Explanation System (RAG Pipeline)” provides sample code and prompt structure.
	3.	Integrate RAG into the Retrieval Step
	•	Build a function match_job_to_candidates(job_text, top_k=5) that:
	1.	Embeds the job text & searches the index (retriever).
	2.	For each top candidate, calls the Generator to produce an explanation.
	3.	Returns a list of (candidate_id, score, explanation).
	•	Reference:
	•	Tech Plan, Section 1.2 discusses combining retrieval with generation.
	4.	Implement Basic Summaries to Avoid Token Overflows
	•	If resumes are lengthy, create a “pre-summarized” version of each resume or limit prompt length.
	•	Reference:
	•	Arch/Tech Overview, “Ensuring Grounding” in LLM usage & mention of prompt engineering for large texts.
	5.	Add Testing & Validation
	•	Functionality Test: Provide a job description, confirm the pipeline returns top candidates with short coherent explanations referencing the candidate’s actual skills.
	•	Performance Test: Evaluate how long it takes for 5 candidates. If it exceeds ~5 seconds, consider parallelizing LLM calls or limiting the explanation to top 3.
	•	Reference:
	•	Tech Plan, Section 1.3 (Evaluation) about verifying generation quality.
	•	MVP PRD, Section 6.2 (Testing) for approach to test coverage (unit + integration).
	6.	Optional – Self-Evaluation Prompt
	•	Implement a second pass where the LLM checks if the explanation is consistent with the retrieved text. This is advanced but recommended for thoroughness.
	•	Reference:
	•	Tech Plan, Section 5.3 (Self-Evaluating Mechanisms).

4. PHASE 3 – AGENT & MULTI-STEP INTERACTIONS

Objective

Enable more complex user flows, such as refining candidate searches in multiple steps via a chat-like interface or agentic approach.

Tasks and References
	1.	Decide on Conversational State Storage
	•	Evaluate using a simple in-memory approach (for short sessions) vs. DynamoDB for storing conversation history in production.
	•	Reference:
	•	Arch/Tech Overview, “Interactive Agent Architecture” clarifies memory handling (storing session data, partial results).
	2.	Implement a Basic Chat Endpoint
	•	Create an endpoint POST /agent that:
	•	Accepts user message + session_id.
	•	Loads conversation history from DB.
	•	Uses a simpler or advanced agent approach to interpret the message.
	•	Possibly calls the retrieval step again with updated filters or refines last results.
	•	Returns updated candidate list or an LLM response.
	•	Reference:
	•	Tech Plan, Section 2 (AI Agents and AutoGPT-Style Interactions).
	3.	Rule-Based vs. LLM-Driven Agent
	•	Rule-Based: A simpler approach checking for keywords like “location” or “years of experience” to re-query the vector DB.
	•	LLM-Driven: Use a “ReAct” pattern with a tool call. The LLM is given a system prompt describing how to call a “SearchCandidates” tool.
	•	Reference:
	•	Arch/Tech Overview, “Agent Design” and code snippet with LangChain as an example.
	4.	Add Agent Memory
	•	If using DynamoDB, store each conversation turn. Let the user ask follow-ups referencing the last search.
	•	Reference:
	•	Arch/Tech Overview, “State Management (Memory)”.
	5.	Test Multi-Turn Flows
	•	Example scenario:
	1.	User: “Find me data scientists with NLP.”
	2.	System returns 5 candidates.
	3.	User: “Which of these knows Spark?”
	4.	System refines results.
	5.	Evaluate correctness & performance.

FINAL NOTES
	•	Refinement and Iteration: As emphasized in Tech Plan, Section 5 (Evaluation, Monitoring, and Continuous Improvement), continue iterating. If retrieval is imprecise, consider fine-tuning embeddings or adding domain filters. If the LLM explanations exhibit hallucination, refine your RAG prompts or reduce prompt scope.
	•	Security & Privacy: The MVP PRD and Tech Plan highlight the need to store resumes and job data responsibly. Use AWS Secrets Manager for credentials and ensure personal data in resumes isn’t logged inadvertently.
	•	User Experience: Even though the MVP focuses on backend, a minimal UI (Phases 2 or 3) helps gather real feedback. Possibly integrate a chat-like interface for recruiters to refine searches in Phase 3.
	•	Continuous Delivery: For production stability, regularly run load tests (Phase 5 or 6) to ensure you meet expected QPS. If concurrency is large, watch out for LLM rate limits (OpenAI or Bedrock). Scale Pinecone pods or switch to approximate indexes in FAISS if you self-host.

By following this multi-phase plan, you can incrementally build, test, and deploy a production-ready AI-driven candidate matcher that aligns precisely with all three reference documents—from the earliest data ingestion steps (Phase 0) through advanced agent interactions and large-scale hosting (Phases 5 & 6).
