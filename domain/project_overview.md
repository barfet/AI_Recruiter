Below is a detailed, step-by-step project plan specifically tailored to showcasing the skills highlighted in the new job posting for a Senior Backend Architect & AI Engineer role at HireBus. The goal is to create a portfolio-worthy demo that demonstrates your ability to build LLM-based features, agentic flows, advanced prompting, and effective use of vector databases—all within a framework like LangChain.

Project Overview

Project Idea: “AI-Driven Candidate Matcher”
	•	Concept: Build a system that ingests a set of open-source job postings and candidate resumes (or other relevant HR data), indexes them in a vector database, and uses LangChain to:
	1.	Automatically answer questions about candidate-job fit.
	2.	Generate advanced multi-step “agent” flows, e.g., prompting the model to:
	•	Summarize candidate backgrounds,
	•	Compare them to job requirements,
	•	Provide recommended interview questions or next steps.
	3.	Implement advanced prompt engineering for robust user queries.
	4.	Evaluate these flows with standardized or custom evaluation metrics.

This mirrors the type of AI workflow described by HireBus—particularly building out LLM-based solutions with context handling, multi-step agent orchestration, and best-of-class evals.

	Important: You can adapt this project to any domain you’re comfortable with (healthcare, finance, etc.). However, using hiring or job data fits closely with HireBus’s domain.

Step 1: Gather & Prepare Data
	1.	Select an Open-Source Dataset:
	•	Kaggle has several job-posting or resume datasets. For instance:
	•	Jobs on Kaggle (search “job postings” or “resume datasets”).
	•	Alternatively, you can scrape or partially sample job postings from Indeed or Glassdoor if TOS allows.
	•	You’ll need a few dozen to a few hundred job postings (title, description, requirements) and corresponding candidate resumes (experience, skills, etc.).
	2.	Data Cleaning & Formatting:
	•	Convert resumes and job postings into a consistent structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV).
	•	Example job posting structure:

{
  "job_id": "12345",
  "title": "Software Engineer",
  "description": "We are looking for...",
  "requirements": "...",
  "company": "XYZ Corp",
  "location": "Remote"
}


	•	Example resume structure:

{
  "candidate_id": "abc123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "experience": ["Software Engineer at...", ...],
  "skills": ["Python", "AWS", "LLM Prompting", ...],
  "education": "BSc in Computer Science"
}


	3.	Data Pipeline Setup:
	•	Use a simple Python script or Jupyter notebook to handle the ingestion and cleaning.
	•	This step ensures your dataset is consistent and ready for embeddings.

Step 2: Set Up Your Tech Stack

2.1 Environment & Tooling
	•	Python (3.9+ recommended)
	•	LangChain for orchestrating LLM-based tasks:
	•	pip install langchain openai
	•	Consider using LangSmith for evaluation and debugging if you want to try advanced logging and eval features.
	•	Vector Database:
	•	For a straightforward local dev setup, you can use FAISS (open-source).
	•	Or sign up for a free tier of Pinecone or Weaviate Cloud to replicate a more production-like environment.
	•	LLM API:
	•	OpenAI (GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) or an open-source LLM on Hugging Face (like Falcon, LLaMA 2, or others).
	•	Serverless + AWS (Optional, if you want to mirror the job’s serverless environment):
	•	AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3 for storing data.
	•	Alternatively, you could containerize with Docker and deploy on AWS Fargate or your platform of choice.

Step 3: Indexing with Vector Embeddings
	1.	Choose an Embedding Model:
	•	If using OpenAI: text-embedding-ada-002 is a good default.
	•	If using local/HF models: sentence-transformers (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
	2.	Create Embeddings:
	•	For each job posting and each resume, generate embedding vectors.
	•	Store them in your vector database (FAISS/Pinecone).

# embeddings.py (simplified example)
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

embedder = OpenAIEmbeddings(model_name="text-embedding-ada-002")

def embed_documents(docs):
    # docs is a list of text strings
    vectors = embedder.embed_documents(docs)
    return vectors

# Example usage
# job_texts = [job["description"] for job in job_posts]
# job_embeddings = embed_documents(job_texts)
# faiss_store = FAISS.from_embeddings(job_embeddings, job_texts)


	3.	Metadata Storage:
	•	Alongside embeddings, store metadata (job_id, candidate_id, etc.) to retrieve relevant items later.
	4.	Testing:
	•	Perform a simple semantic search test to confirm that the retrieval is working properly (e.g., “Find me jobs that mention ‘AWS and Node.js’”).

Step 4: Building the Agentic Flow in LangChain

4.1 Defining the Agent
	•	LangChain provides various “Agent” classes. Start with something like a ConversationalAgent or a more general Tool-using Agent.
	•	The agent’s job:
	1.	Accept a user query or task (e.g., “Compare this candidate’s resume to job ID 12345. How well do they match?”).
	2.	Retrieve relevant context from the vector DB (both the candidate info and the job description).
	3.	Use a prompt template to format that context for the LLM.
	4.	Return a structured response (e.g., a summary or a match score).

4.2 Creating Tools & Chains
	•	Tools: In LangChain, tools are actions the agent can take. For instance:
	1.	SearchJobsTool: Perform a vector search for relevant job postings.
	2.	SearchCandidatesTool: Search for candidate profiles.
	3.	SummaryTool: Summarize the job or candidate details.
	•	Chains: A chain is a sequence of transforms or LLM calls. For example, a “CompareCandidateToJobChain” might:
	1.	Retrieve candidate details → Summarize candidate → Retrieve job details → Summarize job → Perform comparison → Output final “match score” and summary.

Example: Summarizing a Candidate

from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.3, model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo")

candidate_summary_template = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["candidate_experience", "candidate_skills"],
    template="""
    Summarize the candidate's experience and skills in a concise bullet format.
    Candidate Experience: {candidate_experience}
    Candidate Skills: {candidate_skills}
    Summary:
    """
)

candidate_summary_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=candidate_summary_template)

4.3 Multi-Step Agent Workflow
	•	Define an Agent that orchestrates the steps:
	1.	Look up the candidate and job data from your vector DB (using the relevant tool).
	2.	Summarize both.
	3.	Combine the summaries to produce a final “fit analysis,” e.g., “The candidate meets 8 out of 10 key requirements.”
	4.	Generate next steps: recommended interview questions or concerns.

from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool

# define Tools
search_candidates_tool = Tool(
    name="search_candidates",
    func=search_candidates,  # your custom function
    description="Search for candidate profiles using a vector database query."
)

search_jobs_tool = Tool(
    name="search_jobs",
    func=search_jobs,  # your custom function
    description="Search for job postings using a vector database query."
)

# define the agent
tools = [search_candidates_tool, search_jobs_tool, ...]
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,
    agent="zero-shot-react-description",  # or other agent types
    verbose=True
)

# sample usage
user_query = "How does candidate with ID 'abc123' fit job ID '12345'?"
response = agent.run(user_query)
print(response)

Step 5: Advanced Prompt Engineering
	1.	Context Windows:
	•	Use retrieval augmentation: Retrieve the most relevant sections from the job posting or resume.
	•	Limit the text passed to the LLM to avoid token overflow.
	2.	Guardrails:
	•	Provide explicit instructions to the LLM to produce structured JSON output or bullet points to parse easily.
	•	Example:

You are an AI that outputs JSON.
Keys: "fit_score" (0-100), "candidate_strengths", "candidate_weaknesses".
...


	3.	Self-Consistency or Debate:
	•	If you want to demonstrate more advanced techniques, run the LLM multiple times with slightly varied prompts, then compare or “vote” on the best final answer (LangChain has SelfConsistencyChain or custom solutions for this).

Step 6: Evaluations & Evals Integration
	1.	LangChain (LangSmith) Evals:
	•	Log your chain calls to LangSmith to debug prompts and measure response quality.
	•	Evaluate each stage: retrieval correctness, summary accuracy, final match recommendation.
	2.	Custom Metrics:
	•	If you have labeled data with “ground truth” match scores, you can compare the LLM’s suggestions to actual outcomes.
	•	Example: If you have a small validation set of candidate-job pairs with known “match” or “no match,” measure precision, recall, or an F1 score.
	3.	Automated Testing:
	•	Write unit tests for your tools (vector DB search, summarization, chain logic).
	•	For each function (e.g., search_candidates), feed known queries and check if the top result is correct.

Step 7: Backend Architecture & Deployment
	1.	API Layer:
	•	Wrap your agent logic into an API endpoint (e.g., FastAPI or AWS Lambda + API Gateway).
	•	Example:

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/candidate_match/")
def candidate_match(candidate_id: str, job_id: str):
    # agent logic goes here
    response = agent.run(f"Compare candidate {candidate_id} to job {job_id}")
    return {"result": response}


	2.	Serverless (AWS):
	•	Use AWS SAM or Serverless Framework to define a function that runs the agent flow.
	•	Set environment variables for your LLM keys, Pinecone keys, etc.
	3.	DevOps Best Practices:
	•	CI/CD: Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests, lints code, and deploys on merge.
	•	Monitoring: Log all agent requests and responses to CloudWatch for debugging.

Step 8: Demonstrating Advanced Agentic Flows
	1.	Multi-Step Interview Flow:
	•	Agent automatically creates a set of interview questions.
	•	Another agent “scores” candidate answers to those questions.
	•	Combine results for a final match recommendation.
	2.	Prompt “Rewrite” or “Dynamic Prompting”:
	•	If the initial result is unsatisfactory, use a second pass to refine the prompt (dynamic re-prompting) and get an improved result.
	3.	Memory & Context:
	•	Use LangChain’s memory system to keep track of a conversation’s or a session’s progress.
	•	This is especially relevant if a user is exploring multiple candidates or job postings in a single session.

Step 9: Final Polishing & Documentation
	1.	README:
	•	Clearly describe setup instructions, including environment variables for any external LLM or vector DB service.
	•	Provide sample API calls or CLI usage.
	2.	Sample Demo:
	•	Record a short (~5-minute) screencast or Loom video demonstrating:
	•	Launching the service,
	•	Sending a query (e.g., “Compare candidate X to job Y.”),
	•	Reviewing the JSON or structured output.
	3.	Code Quality:
	•	Use consistent Python linting/formatting (Black or Flake8).
	•	Write docstrings for your major classes and functions.
	4.	Extend/Experiment:
	•	If you have time, integrate extra features like:
	•	“Send email” or “Slack notification” when a candidate is a high match,
	•	“Generate an offer letter” prompt flow.

Summary of Deliverables
	1.	Working Agent that uses LangChain to handle:
	•	Semantic search (jobs/candidates) via vector embeddings.
	•	Multi-step or chained LLM calls for summarizing, matching, and generating next steps.
	•	Advanced prompt engineering for structured outputs.
	2.	Evaluation Pipelines:
	•	Basic retrieval and LLM performance checks.
	•	Possibly integrate with LangSmith for logs and advanced prompt debugging.
	3.	Backend/API:
	•	A minimal FastAPI or AWS Lambda function exposing the agent’s capabilities as an endpoint.
	4.	Documentation & Demo:
	•	Detailed README and short demo video.
