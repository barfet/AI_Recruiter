# Your rule content

- [architecture_and_tech_overview.md](mdc:docs/architecture_and_tech_overview.md)
- [implementation_plan.md](mdc:docs/implementation_plan.md)
- Whenever you add or edit code in the agent modules, ensure you incorporate memory handling for multi-turn interactions as described in the Tech Plan (Section 2) and Arch/Tech Overview (Interactive Agent Architecture).
- Use a conversation-state approach (via local memory or DynamoDB), and confirm the agent can reference top candidates from previous steps for refinement queries or explanation generation. Avoid complex file I/O for memoryâ€”keep it ephemeral or DB-based as recommended.
