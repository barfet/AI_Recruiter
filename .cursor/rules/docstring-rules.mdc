globs: **/*.py, **/*.ts

# Your rule content

- [project_requirements_document.md](mdc:docs/project_requirements_document.md)
- [architecture_and_tech_overview.md](mdc:docs/architecture_and_tech_overview.md)
- Each function should include docstrings or JSDoc comments explaining what it does, expected input shape, and references to relevant sections of the MVP PRD if business logic is explained.
- Keep comments consistent with the architecture references (e.g., mention the RAG pipeline if a function calls the LLM with candidate context).
