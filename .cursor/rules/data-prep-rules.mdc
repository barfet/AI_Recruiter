- When writing or modifying data ingestion scripts, make sure to adhere to the Phase 0 and Phase 1 instructions from the MVP PRD and Tech Plan (Section 1.1). Verify that the embedding model usage is consistent and that you handle updates or re-indexing carefully.
- Avoid storing raw personal data in logs or code. Reference the Tech Plan (Section 3.3) for privacy and security guidelines. Use environment variables for any external credentials (e.g., Pinecone, S3).
