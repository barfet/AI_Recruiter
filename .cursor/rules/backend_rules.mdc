description: Rules that apply specifically to Python files in the /backend directory. Reinforces code structure, module separation, and references best practices from the architecture docs.
globs: backend/**/*.py

# Your rule content

- [architecture_and_tech_overview.md](mdc:docs/architecture_and_tech_overview.md)
- [implementation_plan.md](mdc:docs/implementation_plan.md)
- All Python code in /backend should maintain a clear separation of concerns: retrieval logic, generation logic, agent logic, and data I/O must remain decoupled. Adhere to the structure recommended in the Tech Plan (Sections 1.2, 2, and 3).
- Use docstrings (Google or NumPy style) for all new functions. Mention input parameters, return types, and quick usage notes, referencing the MVP PRD for usage context (e.g. job â†’ candidate matching).
- Ensure compliance with the serverless architecture plan: keep import overhead minimal and external connections (like Pinecone, OpenAI) at the global scope to reduce overhead in repeated function calls.
